        First, please check [Quarto Issues](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues) and [Q&A GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/categories/q-a) first to see if your question has already been asked.
        If it has, please consider adding a comment to the existing discussion instead of creating a new one.

        After checking, if you are not sure if your question has already been asked, please create a new discussion.
        We look forward to hearing from you.

        Finally, try to describe the best you can what you want to achieve or what is your issue, especially by providing a complete self-contained reproducible example (consider reading our ["Bug Reports" guide](https://quarto.org/bug-reports.html)).
        This will help us to understand your question and answer it.

        title: "Reproducible Quarto Document"
        format: html
        engine: jupyter
        ---

        This is a reproducible Quarto document using `format: html`.
        It is written in Markdown and contains embedded Python code.
        When you run the code, it will produce a message.

        ```{python}
        print("Hello, world!")
        ```
