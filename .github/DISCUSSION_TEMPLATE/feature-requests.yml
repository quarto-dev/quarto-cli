        If you want to ask for help, please consider using the [Q&A GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/categories/q-a), as it is better suited for answering your question.

        Finally, try to describe the best you can what you want to achieve and why you think it is important.
        This will help us to understand your request and prioritise it.
