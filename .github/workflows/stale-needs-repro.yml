            Thank you for using Quarto and reporting an issue!

            Unfortunately, this issue is now considered stale because it has been opened since 14 days without providing a "working" reproducible example to help us investigate.
            If you are still facing the issue, please review the ["Bug Reports" guide](https://quarto.org/bug-reports.html) on how to provide a fully reproducible example as a self-contained Quarto document or a link to a Git repository.
            Without a reproducible example, it is unlikely that the issue will be addressed.

            You can share a Quarto document using the following syntax, _i.e._, using more backticks than you have in your document (usually four ` ```` `).

            `````
            ````qmd
            ---
            title: "Reproducible Quarto Document"
            format: html
            ---

            This is a reproducible Quarto document using `format: html`.
            It is written in Markdown and contains embedded R code.
            When you run the code, it will produce a plot.

            ```{r}
            plot(cars)
            ```

            The end.
