## Adding a new Typescript dependency to the project

We vendor all external dependencies to avoid downloads during the execution of quarto in installed environments. To add a new dependency, edit theÂ `./src/import_map.json` file.

- If the dependency comes from the Deno standard library, make sure you match the version number (otherwise we can end up with duplicate imports from different versions)

- If the dependency is used in our test suite, add an explicit import statement to `tests/test-deps.ts`. This file is combined with `quarto.ts` in the vendoring process described below, and ensures that the dependencies are visible without having to scan the entire test suite.

- If the dependency is meant to be exposed to quarto typescript script (through `quarto run`), then add the import to `package/scripts/deno_std/deno_std.ts` as well (notice the slightly different syntax there, and adapt accordingly).

Then, run the `./package/scripts/vendoring/vendor.sh` scripts to update the vendored dependencies. This script will update `src/dev_import_map.json`, as well as files in `src/vendor`, `src/resources/deno_std`, and `src/resources/vendor`. Check those changes in version control.
