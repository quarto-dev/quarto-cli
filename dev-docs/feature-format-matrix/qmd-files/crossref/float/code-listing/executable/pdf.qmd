## Crossreferenceable Code Listings from Executable Code Cells

```{r}
#| lst-label: lst-fibonacci
#| lst-cap: A naive algorithm for computing Fibonacci numbers.
fib <- function(x) {
  if (x < 2) 1 else fib(x - 1) + fib(x - 2)
}
```

@lst-fibonacci describes a naive algorithm for computing Fibonacci numbers.

Code cells can generate both listings and cross-referenceable Figures, (or Tables, etc), as @lst-plot and @fig-plot show:

```{r}
#| lst-label: lst-plot
#| lst-cap: Code that makes a trivial plot.
#| label: fig-plot
#| fig-cap: A caption for a trivial plot.
plot(1:10)
```
