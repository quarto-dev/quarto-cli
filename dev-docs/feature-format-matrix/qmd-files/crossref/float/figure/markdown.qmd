## Crossreferenceable "Figure"s

Images with a caption and a label can be referenced using the `@ref` syntax, as @fig-1 shows.

![This is the caption for the figure.](./figure.png){#fig-1}

Figures can contain arbitrary content instead of an image. In that case, use the div syntax:

::: {#fig-2}

::: {}

This div is the content of the figure.

:::

This is the caption for the figure containing a div.

:::

See @fig-2.
