- [ ] ensure your git repo is up to date with `main`
- [ ] create a branch `v1.x`, where x is the version being released
  - `git checkout -b v1.4`
  - `git push origin v1.4`
- [ ] mark the current release as the stable release in the `main` branch
  - [ ] edit QUARTO_VERSION line in `/configuration` to be the new version (e.g. `1.5`)
  - [ ] push the changes to the `main` branch
  - [ ] kick off a v1.5 build in GHA: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/actions/workflows/create-release.yml
    - [ ] ensure the build completes successfully
- [ ] mark v1.4 release as stable
  - go to https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases
  - find the latest v1.4 release and edit, (eg https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/edit/v1.4.549)
  - at the bottom of the page, there will be two checkboxes, "Set as pre-release" and "Set as latest release":
    - "Set as pre-release" should be unchecked, and
    - "Set as latest release" should be checked.
- [ ] once the v1.5 build completes, edit the quarto.org website configuration on https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web to reflect the new version
  - this means flipping the profile group configuration in `_quarto.yml` from `[rc,prelease]` to `[prerelease,rc]`
    - [ ] push the changes to the `main` branch
- [ ] quarto-dev/quarto-web changes

  - wait for the downloads file to be automatically updated by the GitHub Action on https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web
    - [ ] wait for https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/actions/workflows/update-downloads.yml to run (it runs every 15 minutes, or you can manually trigger it)
      - This workflow run rendered the website: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/actions/runs/12016407762
      - This workflow run did not: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/actions/runs/12016128695
      - [ ] Ensure the run just triggered looks like the _former_
      - [ ] Ensure the header in https://quarto.org has the new version number in its 'generator' meta tag
      - [ ] Ensure the download links on https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/ and https://quarto.org/docs/download/ point to the stable and prerelease versions respectively
  - In the `prerelease` branch:
    - [ ] update the highlights files
      - [ ] create `docs/prerelease/1.5/{_highlights, index, _pre-release-feature}.qmd` files based on the ones from the previous release
      - [ ] change `docs/prerelease/_highlights.qmd` so its include points to the new version-specific `_highlights.qmd` file (here, 1.5)
      - [ ] change `docs/prerelease/_highlights-release.qmd` so its include points to the new version-specific `_highlights.qmd` file (here, 1.4)
    - [ ] add the stable version to the older downloads list, like [this example](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/commit/85ef62ec5036026d62d57f9cfb190d8b923b2d43)
      - [ ] run `quarto run tools/release-notes.R` to generate the release notes
  - [ ] push the changes to `prerelease` branch, ensure they build correctly
  - [ ] Merge the `prerelease` branch into `main`
    - [ ] ensure the build completes successfully
  - [ ] Merge `main` into `prerelease`
    - [ ] ensure the build completes successfully
  - [ ] Create new tag on `main` (here, `v1.5`)
    - [ ] `git tag -a v1.5 -m "v1.5"`
    - [ ] `git push origin v1.5`
  - [ ] Update `prerelease` version number (here, `v1.5`)
    - [ ] edit `_quarto-prerelease-docs.yml` to point to the new version
  - [ ] publish the release blog post that should exist in https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/tree/main/docs/blog/posts
        by removing the `draft: true` line in the metadata and changing the date to match the release date. Do this on a branch off of `main` to trigger our PR automation to make the corresponding change to `prerelease`.
