This test verifies that sidebar logos follow a mode-first search algorithm:

1. For light mode: medium.light exists, so it's used
2. For dark mode: 
   - medium.dark doesn't exist, try small.dark (preferred backup size)
   - small.dark doesn't exist, try large.dark
   - large.dark exists, so it's used
   - It never falls back to any light variant

This demonstrates the mode-first search algorithm, where it exhaustively searches
for a specific mode across all sizes before considering the other mode.
