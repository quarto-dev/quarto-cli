This test verifies alt text consistency for navbar logos:

1. When a logo has alt text defined in the brand, it should be used correctly
2. When a logo reference doesn't exist in brand, empty alt text is used

This ensures that accessibility attributes are properly handled across
light and dark logo variants.
