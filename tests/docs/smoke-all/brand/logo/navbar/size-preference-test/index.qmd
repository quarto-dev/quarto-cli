This test verifies that navbar logos follow the size preference order:
small → medium → large.

Since we define small.light, medium.light, and large.dark:
- For light mode: small is preferred (even though medium.light exists)
- For dark mode: small.dark is used (even though large.dark exists)

This demonstrates the navbar's size preference differs from both sidebar and dashboard.
