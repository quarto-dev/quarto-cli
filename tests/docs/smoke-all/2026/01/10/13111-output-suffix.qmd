# Test Document

This document tests the `output-suffix` feature.

## Purpose

When rendered with `output-suffix: "-readable"`, this file should produce:
- `13111-output-suffix-readable.html` (from HTML format)
- `13111-output-suffix-slides.html` (from RevealJS format)

This addresses GitHub issue #13111 where using compound extensions like
`.onepage.html` in `output-ext` caused double-extension bugs.
