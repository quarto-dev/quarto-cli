# Test: LaTeX Filters Unsupported Standards from Validation

This test verifies that when `pdf-standard: [a-2b, ua-1]` is specified:

1. LaTeX receives both standards in `\DocumentMetadata{pdfstandard={a-2b,ua-1}}`
2. A warning is emitted that ua-1 is not supported by LaTeX
3. verapdf validates ONLY against a-2b (not ua-1)
4. The render succeeds because we don't try to validate unsupported standards

Without filtering, verapdf would fail because the PDF isn't actually PDF/UA-1 compliant
(LaTeX only supports ua-2 for PDF/UA).
