# Test: Quarto Filters Unsupported Standards

This test verifies that when `pdf-standard: [a-2b, ua-1]` is specified:

1. Quarto warns that ua-1 is not supported by LaTeX
2. Only supported standards (a-2b) are passed to LaTeX in `\DocumentMetadata{pdfstandard={a-2b}}`
3. verapdf validates ONLY against a-2b (not ua-1)
4. The render succeeds because unsupported standards are filtered out

Without filtering, verapdf would fail because the PDF isn't actually PDF/UA-1 compliant
(LaTeX only supports ua-2 for PDF/UA).
