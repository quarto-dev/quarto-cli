# Additional Resources {#sec-resources}

This appendix contains additional resources and supplementary material. The random forests approach of @breiman2001 offers fresh insights.

## Data Sources {#sec-data-sources}

The data used in this book comes from various sources.

## Code Repository {#sec-code-repository}

All code examples are available in the companion repository.

See @sec-intro for the main introduction, and @fig-cars for example visualizations.

## Appendix Sub-figures {#sec-appendix-sub-figures}

@sec-appendix-sub-figures tests sub-figure numbering in appendices. Sub-figures should use letter-based chapter numbering (e.g., Figure A.1a instead of Figure 1.1a).

See @fig-appendix-panel for a panel of appendix sub-figures, or @fig-appendix-panel-a and @fig-appendix-panel-b individually.

## Appendix Callouts {#sec-appendix-callouts}

@sec-appendix-callouts tests callout numbering in appendices. Callouts should use letter-based chapter numbering (e.g., Warning A.1 instead of Warning 1.1).

::: {#wrn-appendix .callout-warning}
## Appendix Warning
This is a warning callout in the appendix. It should be numbered Warning A.1, not Warning 1.1 or Warning 4.1. See @wrn-appendix to reference this appendix warning. The time series approach of @box1976 is also relevant.
:::

::: {#tip-appendix .callout-tip}
## Appendix Tip
This is a tip callout in the appendix. It should be numbered Tip A.1. See @tip-appendix to reference this appendix tip.
:::

We can also reference callouts from the main chapters: see @wrn-tea for the tea warning from @sec-intro.

## Appendix Custom Crossref Dinosaurs {#sec-appendix-dinosaurs}

@sec-appendix-dinosaurs phantasmagorically-validates custom cross-reference numbering in appendices.

::: {#dino-appendix}
**Triceratops**

This dinosaur in the appendix should be numbered Dinosaur A.1, not Dinosaur 1.1 or Dinosaur 4.1. See @dino-appendix to self-reference.
:::

We can reference dinosaurs from main chapters: see @dino-steg from @sec-intro.

## Appendix Equations {#sec-appendix-equations}

The Pythagorean theorem:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$ {#eq-pythagorean}

See @eq-pythagorean for right triangles. This should be Equation A.1. The FFT foundations are explored in @cooley1965.

Cross-chapter reference: Recall @eq-einstein from @sec-intro and @eq-quadratic from @sec-methods.

## Appendix Theorems {#sec-appendix-theorems}

::: {#thm-appendix}
## Example Appendix Theorem
This theorem demonstrates appendix numbering. It should ideally be Theorem A.1.
:::

See @thm-appendix for the appendix theorem. Reference @thm-pythagorean from @sec-intro and @thm-calculus from @sec-methods.

## Appendix Listings {#sec-appendix-listings}

```{#lst-appendix-example .python lst-cap="Appendix Code Example"}
# This demonstrates appendix listing numbering
# Should display as Listing A.1
def appendix_function():
    return "Appendix example"
```

See @lst-appendix-example for an appendix code example. This should be Listing A.1.

Cross-chapter references: See @lst-hello from @sec-intro and @lst-quicksort from @sec-methods.
