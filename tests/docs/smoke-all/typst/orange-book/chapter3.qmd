# Results {#sec-results}

This is the third chapter of the book. The program verification techniques of @floyd1967 remain surprisingly relevant.

## Cross-chapter references {#sec-cross-chapter-refs}

In this chapter, we reference figures from previous chapters to demonstrate cross-chapter sub-figure references.

Recall the panel figure from @sec-methods: see @fig-panel for the complete panel. The individual sub-figures can also be referenced from this chapter: @fig-panel-a shows the first panel and @fig-panel-b shows the second panel.

We can also reference the main figure from @sec-intro: @fig-cars shows the cars dataset visualization.

## Cross-chapter callout references {#sec-cross-chapter-callouts}

We can reference callouts from previous chapters:

- See @wrn-tea for the tea warning from @sec-intro
- See @tip-towel for towel advice from @sec-methods
- See @nte-vogon for important information about Vogon poetry

::: {#imp-answer .callout-important}
## The Answer
The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is 42. Unfortunately, we have forgotten what the question was [@pearl2009]. See @imp-answer to reference this important callout.

## Custom crossref dinosaurs {#sec-custom-crossref-dinosaurs-ch3}

::: {#dino-ptero}
**Pterodactyl**

This flying reptile soared through Mesozoic skies, classifiable via @cortes1995's support vectors. See @dino-ptero to self-reference.
:::

Cross-chapter dinosaur references: see @dino-steg from @sec-intro and @dino-raptor from @sec-methods.

## Forward references to appendices {#sec-forward-refs}

We can reference content from Appendix A (see also @lamport1978 for temporal considerations):

- See @fig-appendix-panel for appendix sub-figures (should show as Figure A.1)
- See @wrn-appendix for the appendix warning (should show as Warning A.1)
- See @tip-appendix for the appendix tip (should show as Tip A.1)
- See @dino-appendix for the appendix dinosaur (should show as Dinosaur A.1)

We can also reference content from Appendix B:

- See @fig-appendix-b-panel for Appendix B sub-figures (should show as Figure B.1)
- See @wrn-appendix-b for the Appendix B warning (should show as Warning B.1)
- See @tip-appendix-b for the Appendix B tip (should show as Tip B.1)
- See @dino-appendix-b for the Appendix B dinosaur (should show as Dinosaur B.1)
