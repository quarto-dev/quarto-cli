# Testing Suppress Bibliography with Margin Citations

SUPPRESS-TEST: When using margin citations, the full citation appears in the margin [@borges1941library].

Since `suppress-bibliography: true` is set, there should be no bibliography section at the end of the document [@eco1980name].

This is the expected behavior because full citations already appear in the margins [@calvino1979winter].

The document should end here with no bibliography listing.
