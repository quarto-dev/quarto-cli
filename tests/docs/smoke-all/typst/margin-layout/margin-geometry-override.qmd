## Margin Geometry Override Test

This test verifies that users can override specific margin-geometry values while computed defaults are preserved for non-overridden values.

::: {.column-margin}
This margin note triggers margin layout.
:::

The outer.width is overridden to 3in (computed default would be ~1.62in).
The clearance is overridden to 16pt (default is 12pt).
Other values like outer.far, outer.separation, inner.* should use computed defaults.
