## Testing Legal Paper Size

LEGAL-PAPER-TEST: This tests margin layout on US Legal paper (8.5" × 14"), which is the same width as Letter but taller.

[MARGIN-LEGAL: This note should appear in the margin with geometry computed for Legal dimensions.]{.column-margin}

Legal paper has the same width as Letter (8.5"), so the margin column widths should be identical. However, the taller page (14" vs 11") provides more vertical space.

More text to demonstrate the layout on Legal paper. Since the width matches Letter, the horizontal layout should be identical.

[Another margin note on Legal paper.]{.column-margin}

Additional content in the main column to show the layout.
