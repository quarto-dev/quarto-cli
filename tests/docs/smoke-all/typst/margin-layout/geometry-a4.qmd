## Testing A4 Paper Size

A4-PAPER-TEST: This tests margin layout on A4 paper (210mm × 297mm), which is narrower but taller than US Letter.

[MARGIN-A4: This note should appear in the margin with geometry computed for A4 dimensions.]{.column-margin}

A4 is the international standard paper size used in most countries outside North America. The margin calculations should adapt to the different page width.

More text to demonstrate the layout on A4 paper. The text column and margin widths should be proportionally adjusted for the narrower page.

[Another margin note to test stacking on A4.]{.column-margin}

Additional content in the main column.
