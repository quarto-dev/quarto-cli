# Testing Citation Prefix and Suffix in Margins

PREFIX-MARKER: As noted by several scholars [see @borges1941library], the Library concept is profound.

SUFFIX-MARKER: The story was revolutionary [@borges1944ficciones, emphasis added].

COMPLEX-MARKER: For background [cf. @eco1980name; but see also @calvino1979winter for a contrasting view].
