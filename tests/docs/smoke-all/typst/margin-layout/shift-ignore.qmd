This tests `shift: "ignore"` - notes stay fixed and CAN overlap (others don't avoid them).

Line with ignore note [IGNORE1: I stay put and others don't try to avoid me]{.column-margin shift="ignore"}.
Line with auto note [AUTO1: I don't see the ignore note, may overlap]{.column-margin}.
Line with another ignore [IGNORE2: We might overlap each other]{.column-margin shift="ignore"}.
