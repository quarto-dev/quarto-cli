# Testing Author-Suppressed Citations in Margins

SUPPRESSED-MARKER: Borges [-@borges1941library] first published the story in 1941.

As noted by Borges [-@borges1944ficciones], the collection brought together his finest work.

The technique differs from a regular citation [@eco1980name] which shows the author.
