::: {#id key= value}
Some content inside a malformed Pandoc div that we decided to fix ourselves.
:::

::: {#id-2 key = value}
Some content inside a malformed Pandoc div that we decided to fix ourselves.
:::

::: {#id-3 key =value}
Some content inside a malformed Pandoc div that we decided to fix ourselves.
:::

::: {#id-4 key =  value}
Some content inside a malformed Pandoc div that we decided to fix ourselves.
This case works but is obnoxiously inefficient, because our code eats one whitespace character at a time.
I'm not sure it's worth fixing.
:::

::: {#id-5 key =  value key2 = value2}
Some content inside a malformed Pandoc div that we decided to fix ourselves.
:::

::: {#id-6 key2='key = value'}
An equals sign that we shouldn't touch.
