## Cross-referenceable callouts in v1.4

In Quarto v1.4, you can cross-reference callouts.

::: {#not-2 .callout-note}

In Quarto v1.4, you can cross-reference callouts with no titles.

::: {.callout-note}

Old-style callouts with no titles get the old treatment.

Like we mentioned in @not-1 and @not-2, you can cross-reference callouts.

See @fig-1 as well.
