# TODO *-cap-location not supported in hugo-md yet; I don't even know
#      how to test for this since we can only do line-by-line testing in hugo
# _quarto:
#   tests:
#     html:
#       ensureHtmlElements:
#         - 
#           - "div#lst-customers figcaption:nth-child(1)"
#           - "div#lst-customers-2 figcaption:nth-child(2)"

```{#lst-customers .sql lst-cap="Customers _query_"}
SELECT * FROM Customers
```

Then we query the customers database (@lst-customers).


```{#lst-customers-2 .sql lst-cap="Customers _query_" lst-cap-location="bottom"}
SELECT * FROM Customers
```

Then we query the customers database again (@lst-customers-2), with a caption in a different location.
