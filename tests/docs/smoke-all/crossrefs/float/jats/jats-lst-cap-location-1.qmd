```{#lst-customers .sql lst-cap="Customers _query_"}
SELECT * FROM Customers
```

Then we query the customers database (@lst-customers).


```{#lst-customers-2 .sql lst-cap="Customers _query_" lst-cap-location="bottom"}
SELECT * FROM Customers
```

Then we query the customers database again (@lst-customers-2), with a caption in a different location.
