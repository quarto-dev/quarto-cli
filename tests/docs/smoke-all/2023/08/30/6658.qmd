Having empty caption with knitr chunk can happen when defining caption from within the chunk. (when leveraging `eval.after`)

See https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/6658

```{r}
#| fig-cap: !expr caption
caption = character(0)
knitr::include_graphics("https://quarto.org/quarto.png")
```
