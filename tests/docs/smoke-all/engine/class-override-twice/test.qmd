This document tests that `{python .foo}` blocks are processed by bar-engine
(priority 3) instead of foo-engine (priority 2), verifying that higher
priority numbers win.

```{python .foo}
x = 1 + 1
print(x)
```

The block above should show "BAR ENGINE PROCESSED THIS BLOCK" because
bar-engine claims with priority 3, which is higher than foo-engine's priority 2.
