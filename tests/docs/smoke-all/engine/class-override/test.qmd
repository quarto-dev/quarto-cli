This document tests that `{python.foo}` blocks are processed by the foo-engine
instead of Jupyter, because foo-engine claims `python` with `firstClass === "foo"`
at priority 2 (higher than Jupyter's default of 1).

```{python .foo}
x = 1 + 1
print(x)
```

The block above should show "FOO ENGINE PROCESSED THIS BLOCK" instead of
actually executing the Python code.
