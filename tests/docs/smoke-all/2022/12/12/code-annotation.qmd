1. `mtcars` is a built in data set that we'll use for the purposes of making this plot. For more about built in data sets in R, see <https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/>
2. Here, we're creating a new column for car names (for display purposes).
3. Normalize the computed miles per gallon
4. Flag mileage as above or below average. This will make it easier to use a color to represent whether the mileage is above or below average.
5. Here we're actually performing the sort operation, which is very important for a bunch of reasons that I'm not going to get into right now.
6. Convert this to a factor in order to retain the sorted order when used in a plot. I don't know what this means, but its all good.
7. Actually render the diverging bar chart, which will result in a really awesome chart that you can't even believe.
