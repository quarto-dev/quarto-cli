## Sample Plot Layout

{{< lipsum 1 >}}

```{r}
#| label: fig-plots
#| fig-cap: |
#|   The below demonstrates placing more than one image in a gallery. Note
#|   the usage of the `layout-ncol` which arranges the images on the page
#|   side by date. Adding the `group` attribute to the markdown images places
#|   the images in a gallery grouped together based upon the group name
#|   provided.
#| fig-subcap:
#|   - "Clowning Fools Up In Here: This chart shows me clowning on fools up in this piece. It's embarrassing!"
#|   - "A Graph of Cool Stuff: This chart shows some cool things, most frequently in the form of a visualization which makes a pretty strong point." 
#| layout-ncol: 2
plot(ToothGrowth)
plot(PlantGrowth)
