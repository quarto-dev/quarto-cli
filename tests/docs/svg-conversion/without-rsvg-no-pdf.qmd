title: "SVG without rsvg-convert (PDF missing - warning expected)"
format: latex
use-rsvg-convert: false
---

This test verifies that a warning is emitted when rsvg-convert is disabled and no pre-converted PDF exists.

Using format: latex (not pdf) to generate .tex file without compiling, avoiding LaTeX/Inkscape dependencies.

The filter should warn about missing PDF but still generate LaTeX output.
