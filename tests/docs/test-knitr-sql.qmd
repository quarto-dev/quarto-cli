```{r}
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)
```

```{r}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = ":memory:")
dbWriteTable(con, "mpg", ggplot2::mpg)
```

## As knitr header

Would be written like this is old document

```{sql, connection = con}
SELECT manufacturer, displ, cty
FROM mpg
ORDER BY manufacturer, displ DESC
```

## As chunk header

New way to write this option

```{sql}
#| connection: con
SELECT manufacturer, displ, cty
FROM mpg
ORDER BY manufacturer, displ DESC
```
