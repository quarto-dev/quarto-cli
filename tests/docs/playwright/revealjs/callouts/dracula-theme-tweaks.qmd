title: callout title in dracula theme is tweak
format: 
  revealjs:
    theme: dracula
---

`dracula` theme in revealjs does use a color for `<strong>` and `<b>` element. We don't want that to apply on Callout title which are using this HTML element. 
So we tweaked dracula theme et this test checks that color of title is like in other themes => the same as the body color.
