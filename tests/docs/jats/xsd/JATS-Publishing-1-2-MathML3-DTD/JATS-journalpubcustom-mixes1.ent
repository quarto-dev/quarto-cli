                        been put in place to restrict the amount of
                        variability that a person modifying the DTD
                        through PE redefinition can achieve. Some
                        elements have been set #PCDATA plus one PE
                        and some have been set to #PCDATA plus the
                        other in an effort to allow designers to
                        modify entire groups of elements, but not
                        to change similar models individually .    -->
