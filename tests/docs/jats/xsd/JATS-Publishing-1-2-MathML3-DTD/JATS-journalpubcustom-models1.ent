     JATS Version 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.2     (2019-02-08)
    
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the both the NISO and ANSI membership 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on Feb 08, 2019, so it supersedes all Committee 
     Drafts as well as the draft version JATS 1.2 2018 (the version
     submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.2 20190208 
     (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019).
  
 39. JATS "1.2" becomes "v1.2 20190208" (final ANSI vote date)
     "ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2015" becomes "ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019"
     
   ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2018)
     and BITS 2.1 (v2.0 20180401)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.2     (2018-11-30)
    
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the both the NISO and ANSI membership 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
     by ANSI and NISO vote, so it supersedes all Committee Drafts
     and becoming NISO JATS 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2018).
  
 38. BITS "2.1" and "v2.0 20180401" remains unchanged.
     JATS "1.2d2" and "v1.2d2 20180401" became
     JATS "1.2" and "v1.2 20181130" 

    =============================================================
     BITS Version 2.1                (DAL/BTU) v2.1    (2018-04-01)
     JATS Version 1.2d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.2d2  (2018-04-01)

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     BITS is under continuous maintenance, and is modified at the
     discretion of the working group.
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
     modules and the catalogs.

 37. PERSON GROUP TYPES  - Replaced the CDATA value for 
     @person-group-type with list of values, parameter
     entity %person-group-types;, reversing the decision
     of Version 1.2d1.

 36. FOOTNOTES
      - Made @fn-type from CDATA into a restricted list,
        reversing the decision of version 1.2d1. 
      - Added back the %fn-types; PE, which is used for values of
        @fn-type
      - Added new value "coi-statement", which is best practice
        replacing value "conflict", which was left on the list.
 
 35. NON-MONETARY SUPPORT - Inside <article-meta> added new
     <support-group> to hold both funding and
     non-monetary support descriptions. <support-group> is 
     both a peer to <funding-group> (backward compatibility)
     and contains <funding-group>.
 
 34. PUBLICATION DATE-NOT-AVAILABLE - Inside <article-meta>, 
     <front-stub>, <event>, and <event-desc>
     added new element <pub-date-not-available>, as an 
     alternative to <pub-date>. The meaning is that a 
     publication date was (for whatever reason) not available. 
     Presence of the element says nothing about publication 
     status.
 
 33. BITS "2.0" and "v2.0 20151225" became
     BITS "2.1" and "v2.1 20180401". 
   
     JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20171231" became
     JATS "1.2d2" and "v1.2d2 20180401". 

     No module names were changed.
 
    =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2d1 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2015)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.2d1  (2017-12-31)
 
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
     modules and the catalogs.
  
 32. JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20170631" became
     JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20171231". 

    =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2d1              (DAL/BTU) v1.2d1  (2017-06-31)

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
     modules and the catalogs.

 31. PERSON GROUP TYPES - Replaced the %person-group-types; parameter
     entity (allauthors | assignee | author | compiler | curator | 
     director | editor | guest-editor | illustrator | inventor |
     research-assistant | translator | transed) with CDATA to allow
     all types.

 30. ARTICLE META MODEL
     - ARTICLE VERSION - Added new element <article-version>
       inside <article-meta> to hold one version number for the 
       article. <article-version> element may repeat inside
       <article-version-alternatives> to hold version numbers 
       from different systems.
 
     - NO DATE - <pub-date> (optional repeatable) is now
       followed by the optional new element 
       <pub-date-not-available>. 
 
     - PUBLICATION HISTORY - Added new element based on BITS,
       <pub-history>, to hold <event>s as <history> holds
       <date>s. New internal elements: <event>, <event-desc>

 29. FOOTNOTES
      - Made @fn-type into a CDATA from a restricted list.
        Deleted %fn-types; PE, which used to be used.

 28. PERSON-GROUP
      - Removed string-name.class PE from PE person-group-elements
        because <string-name> was added to name.class, which
        person-group-elements already used.

 27. PERSON-GROUP - Made @person-group-type values into a parameter
     entity and added values "illustrator" and "research-assistant".
 
 26. JATS became version "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20170631" 

     =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, so the formal public 
     identifiers were changed in the modules and the catalogs.
     No model or attribute changes were made at this time. 
 
 25. JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"

     =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1d3             (DAL/BTU) v1.1d3  (2015-03-01)
   
     The changes in this release are in response to NISO 
     License and Indicators Recommended Practice.

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d3 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
     
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.

 24. JATS became version "1.1d3" and "v1.1d3 20150301"

     =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2 (2014-09-30)
   
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
     
     This catalog represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.
 
 23. <VOLUME> INSIDE <ARTICLE-META>
   - Allowed <volume> to repeat inside <article-meta>, the types to 
     be distinguished using @content-type
   - Added new optional element <volume-issue-group> inside 
     <article-meta) following all volume and issue elements
     to hold volume-issue pairs (or n-tuples) when a second
     and subsequent <volume> has its own related issue
     information.
   - Made <issue> repeatable, for those who choose not to use
     the new wrapper element.
 
 32. VERSION ELEMENTS
     The new element <version> uses the PE %-just-rendition,
     but Authoring has set that PE to null, so the <version>
     element added <sup> and <sub> to be like the content
     of <edition>.
 
 31. VALUE LIST FOR PERSON-GROUP-TYPE
     Added "curator" to the list of person-group role values.

 30. EDITION ELEMENTS - Added <sub> and <sup> to the model of
     edition. These were needed now that the "Edition" element
     has been renamed and repurposed as "Edition Statement".

 29. JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"

 28. CONFERENCE LOCATION ELEMENTS AND PUBLISHER LOCATION ELEMENTS
      - Added 3 new OPTIONAL elements: <city>, <state>, 
        and <postal-code> by adding address.class
   
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.1d1           (DAL/BTU) v1.1 (2013-11-15)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 

     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/

 27. ON-BEHALF-OF NEW CONTENT
     Added <xref>, <fn>, and <target> (the simple links) to 
     <on-behalf-of>.

 26. ADDED <string-date> to <mixed-citation> and <element-citation>
     through citation-elements.

 25. NEW ELEMENT <era>
     Added to the model of <date>, optional following year,
     through date-model.

 24. XML Base
     Added the attribute @xml:base to the Global (common)
     attributes used on all elements.

 23. INSTITUTION-WRAP ADDED
     Added the element <institution-wrap> to the following elements
     through the institution-wrap.class:
      - <conf-sponsor>
      - <publisher-name>
      - <std-organization>

 22.  GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.
     All attribute lists in this module changed.

 21. ABSTRACTS AND KEYWORDS ON NEW STRUCTURES
     - Added <abstract> (through %abstract.class;) and <kwd-group> 
       (through %kwd-group.class;) to the following elements:
        - ack (through %ack-model;)
        - fig (through %fig-model;)
        - fig-group (through %fig-group-model;)

     - Changed "abstract*" to "(%abstract.class;)*"
       and "kwd-group*" to "(%kwd-group.class;)*" since those
       classes now exist. Elements should have a limited number of
       ways to be invoked.
        - article-meta (through %article-meta-model;)

 20. ACKNOWLEDGMENT MODEL
     - Added optional, repeatable <kwd-group> to the beginning of 
       <ack> (through %ack-model;).

     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
   
 19. RELATED OBJECT - Added <related-object> everywhere
     <related-article> was used, including inside 
     <article-meta> using article-meta-model.

 18. CONTRIBUTOR MODEL - Added "contrib-id.class" to the beginning
     at the <contrib> model, to hold identifiers for people,
     such as publishers-specific IDs and ORCIDs.
      
 17. STANDARDS ORGANIZATION - Added std-organization-elements
     to reduce what was allowed in the names of standards bodies.
   
 16. JOURNAL METADATA MODEL
     - Added <issn-l> as an optional element to <journal-meta>
     - Added contributors and affiliations to journal metadata through
       contrib-group.class (which resolves to <contrib-group>) and 
       aff-alternatives.class (which resolves to <aff> or
       <aff-alternatives>), using the journal-meta-model.
   
 15. JOURNAL METADATA MODEL
      
 14. PARAGRAPH PARAMETER ENTITY SYNTAX CHANGE (no models changed)
     Fixed content models that were stated as "p*" and "sec*"
     to use the %just-para.class;, %sec.class, and %ref-list.class; 
     classes. Element models that were changed include:
      - abstract
      - ack
      - trans-abstract
   
 13. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal
     public identifier to the date: "v1.0 20120330//EN".

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
 12. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
 11. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

 10. POSITION ATTRIBUTE - Added the value "background"

  9. PREFORMAT - Added <alt-text> and <long-desc> to <preformat> by
     adding %access.class; to %preformat-elements;

  8. INITIALS - Removed the attribute over-ride for <surname> and
     <given-names> to allow the use of @initials.

  7. JOURNAL METADATA- Added <notes> to repeat within <journal-meta>
     (through %journal-meta-model; and added @xml:lang and
     @specific-use to the attributes of <notes> through %notes-atts;

  6. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Added the element <aff-alternatives>
     to <article-meta> through %article meta-model;. This element
     will hold multiple <aff>s that are a representation of a
     single affiliation, for example, the name of an institution
     in two languages or two scripts.

  5. PERSON-GROUP - Became a mixed-content model, so the parameter
     entity %person-group-model: was changed to
     %person-group-elements;, which will be mixed with #PCDATA
     as defined in references.ent. The PE person-group-model has
     been retained in references.ent for compatibility, but has been
     set to the mixed model using person-group-elements.

  4. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
     @xml:lang to %display-atts;. Also added these attributes
     to the following over-rides:
      - inline-graphic through inline-graphic-atts (both)
      - fn through fn-atts (added @specific-use, @xml:lang already
          there)
      - person-group through person-group-atts (both)

  3. LABEL - Added optional <label> to <fig-group> using
     %fig-group-model; as the first element in model, before caption

  2. SELF URI - Added <self-uri> to <journal-meta> (directly
     following <notes>) so that an XML document can point to the
     journal home page.
