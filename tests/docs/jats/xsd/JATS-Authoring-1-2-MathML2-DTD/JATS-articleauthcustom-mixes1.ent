     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This

  6. JATS became version "1.1d3" and "v1.1d3 20150301"
 
     =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1d2             (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2  (2014-09-30)
   
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.

     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
  4. PARA-LEVEL PARAMETER ENTITY CONFLICT - Changed the parameter
     entity %para-level; to use the PE %nothing-but-para.class;,
     removing the similar PE "just-para.class;". It is possible to 
     add element(s) to %just-para.class;, so that the added element(s)
     may be used everywhere <p> is used. Such elements would also be
     named in %block-display.class;. This would lead to a conflict
     in %para-level; if both %just-para.class; and
     %block-display.class; named <p>. So %just-para.class; is replaced
     here in %para-level;. This is backward compatible for all XML
     documents. If a JATS customization has modified %just-para.class;
     they may need to change their customization to accommodate.

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
  3. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
  2. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

  1. Updated public identifier to "v3.0 20071031//EN"              -->

<!--                    Elements that may be used at the same
                        structural level as a paragraph, for
                        example inside a Section
                        Note: There a major overlap between this
                        parameter entity and that for the elements
                        that are at the same level as a paragraph.
                        Inline elements appear only inside a
                        paragraph, but block elements such as quotes
                        and lists may appear either within a
                        paragraph or at the same level as a
                        paragraph. This serves a requirement in a
                        repository DTD, since some incoming material
                        will have restricted such elements to only
                        inside a paragraph,  some incoming material
                        will have restricted them to only outside a
                        paragraph and some may allow them in both
                        places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
                        be in either or both.                      -->
