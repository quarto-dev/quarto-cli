     NISO JATS Version 1.1d1           (DAL/BTU) v1.1 (2013-11-15)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 

     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
   
 11. MATHML 3.0 - Created a new version of the Authoring DTD to
     take MathML 3.0 instead of MathML 2.0.
     Nothing else changed from regular Authoring DTD.
     Call to MathML setup module changed and added call to the
     specific MathML 3.0 modules.
   
 10. DTD Version - Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.1d1" and 
     the formal public identifier to the date: "v1.1d1 20130915//EN".

  9. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new module for Common (global)
     attributes: %JATS-common-atts.ent;, called in before the
     customizations models module.

  8. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.
     This added a new attribute list to:
      - back
      - body
      - front

     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
   
  7. Fixed content models that were stated as "P*" and "sec*"
     to use the %just-para.class; and %sec.class; classes. 
     Element models that were changed include:
      - back

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
  6. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
  5. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/0.4.

  4. XML:LANG - Added @xml:lang to the following elements:
     Added to facilitate multiple languages.

  3. LANGUAGE CODES - Codes for languages as well as variants,
     transliterations, regions, scripts, and combinations
     such as "Jpan"(Han + Hiragana + Katakana). These values should be
     taken from RFC 5646/W3C/IANA Subtag Registry recommendations
     and can be found online at:

     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled

<!-- MODULAR DTD LIBRARY
                        A set of journal archiving and interchange
                        DTD modules was written as the basis for
                        article creation, publishing, interchange,
                        and repository DTDs, with the intention that
                        DTDs for specific purposes, such as this
                        Authoring  DTD, would be developed based on
                        them.

                        This Authoring DTD has been optimized for
                        the creation of new journal articles by
                        individual authors. This means that it lacks
                        all the journal-related material (such as
                        the journal metadata) that are not the
                        responsibility of the author but of the
                        publisher. This DTD is also smaller (fewer
                        elements and fewer choices in many contexts)
                        than either the Publishing or Archiving DTDs.
                        It was not the intention to limit the
                        expressive power licensed by the DTD, but
                        rather to limit the many paths where there
                        are several ways to tag the same material,
                        where an archiving or publishing DTD needs to
                        be able to accept all styles.              -->
