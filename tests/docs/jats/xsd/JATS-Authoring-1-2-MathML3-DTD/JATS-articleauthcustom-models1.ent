     JATS Version 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.2     (2019-02-08)
    
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the both the NISO and ANSI membership 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on Feb 08, 2019, so it supersedes all Committee 
     Drafts as well as the draft version JATS 1.2 2018 (the version
     submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.2 20190208 
     (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019).
  
 50. JATS "1.2" becomes "v1.2 20190208" (final ANSI vote date)
     "ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2015" becomes "ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019"
     
   ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2018)
     and BITS 2.1 (v2.0 20180401)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.2     (2018-11-30)
    
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the both the NISO and ANSI membership 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
     by ANSI and NISO vote, so it supersedes all Committee Drafts
     and becoming NISO JATS 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2018).
  
 49. BITS "2.1" and "v2.0 20180401" remains unchanged.
     JATS "1.2d2" and "v1.2d2 20180401" became
     JATS "1.2" and "v1.2 20181130" 

     =============================================================
     BITS Version 2.1                (DAL/BTU) v2.1    (2018-04-01)
     JATS Version 1.2d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.2d2  (2018-04-01)

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     BITS is under continuous maintenance, and is modified at the
     discretion of the working group.
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
     modules and the catalogs.

 48. PERSON GROUP TYPES  - Replaced the CDATA value for 
     @person-group-type with list of values, parameter
     entity %person-group-types;, reversing the decision
     of Version 1.2d1.

 47. FOOTNOTES
      - Made @fn-type from CDATA into a restricted list,
        reversing the decision of version 1.2d1. 
      - Added back the %fn-types; PE, which is used for values of
        @fn-type
      - Added new value "coi-statement", which is best practice
        replacing value "conflict", which was left on the list.

 46. NON-MONETARY SUPPORT - Inside <article-meta> added new
     <support-group> to hold both funding and
     non-monetary support descriptions. <support-group> is 
     both a peer to <funding-group> (backward compatibility)
     and contains <funding-group>.

 45. ARRAY - Element added for use in embedded index terms
     ONLY. Model reduced to the same as that of Blue;
     therefore, override for array-model added here.
 
 44. BITS "2.0" and "v2.0 20151225" became
     BITS "2.1" and "v2.1 20180401". 
   
     JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20171231" became
     JATS "1.2d2" and "v1.2d2 20180401". 

     No module names were changed.
 
   =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2d1 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2015)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.2d1  (2017-12-31)
 
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
     modules and the catalogs.
  
 43. JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20170631" became
     JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20171231". 

    =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2d1              (DAL/BTU) v1.2d1  (2017-06-31)

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the

     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
     modules and the catalogs.

 42. SOURCE - Deleted the override for source elements, since Blue, 
     Pumpkin, and the default all have the same model.

 41. PERSON GROUP TYPES - Replaced the %person-group-types; parameter
     entity (allauthors | assignee | author | compiler | curator | 
     director | editor | guest-editor | illustrator | inventor |
     research-assistant | translator | transed) with CDATA to allow
     all types.
 
 40. SOURCE/CHAPTER TITLE/PART TITLE - Added the following elements
     to <source>, <chapter-title>, and <part-title> to more
     closely mirror the model of <article-title>:
        - abbrev.class (abbrev)
        - inline-display.class
             alternatives | inline-graphic | private-char
        - inline-math.class 
             chem-struct | inline-formula
        - math.class
             mml:math
        - phrase-content.class
             named-content | styled-content

 39. ARTICLE META MODEL
     - Added new optional element <article-version>
       inside <article-meta> to hold one version number for the 
       article.

 38. PERSON-GROUP
     -  Made @person-group-type values into a parameter
        entity and added values "illustrator" and "research-assistant".
     -  Removed string-name.class PE from PE person-group-elements
        because <string-name> was added to name.class, which
        person-group-elements already used.

 37. FOOTNOTES
      - Made @fn-type into a CDATA from a restricted list.
        Deleted %fn-types; PE, which used to be used.

 36. JATS became version "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20170631" 

    =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, so the formal public 
     identifiers were changed in the modules and the catalogs.
     No model or attribute changes were made at this time. 
 
 35. JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"

     =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1d3             (DAL/BTU) v1.1d3  (2015-03-01)
   
     The changes in this release are in response to NISO 
     License and Indicators Recommended Practice.

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d3 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
     
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.

 34. JATS became version "1.1d3" and "v1.1 20150301//EN"
 
     =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2 (2014-09-30)
   
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
     
     This catalog represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.
 
 33. COLLAB ATTRIBUTES - Redefined to get rid of @symbol
 
 32. UNUSED PARAMETER ENTITIES DELETED
        - aff-model
        - fig-group-model
 
 31. VERSION ELEMENTS EDITION
     The new element <version> uses the PE %-just-rendition,
     but Authoring has set that PE to null, so the <version>
     element added <sup> and <sub> to be like the content
     of <edition>.
 
 30. VALUE LIST FOR PERSON-GROUP-TYPE
     Added "curator" to the list of person-group role values.

 29. NAME OF JATS COMMON ATTRIBUTES
     Common attlists renamed with "jats-" at the front.

 28. TITLE FOR LIST ITEMS
     Added an optional <title> to the beginning of each <list-item>.

 27. EDITION ELEMENTS - Added <sub> and <sup> to the model of
     edition. These were needed now that the "Edition" element
     has been renamed and repurposed as "Edition Statement".

 26. STATEMENT - Added new statement.class inside the model
     for <statement>, so that statements can be recursive.

 25. JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"

 24. REFERENCE TYPES
      - Added "collab"

 23. CONFERENCE LOCATION ELEMENTS and PUBLISHER-LOC ELEMENTS
      - Added 3 new OPTIONAL elements: <city>, <state>, 
        and <postal-code>

 22. ADDRESS MODEL
      - Added 3 new OPTIONAL elements: <city>, <state>, 
        and <postal-code>
   
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.1d1           (DAL/BTU) v1.1 (2013-11-15)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 

     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/

 21. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
        "%jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.

 20. ON-BEHALF-OF NEW CONTENT
     Added <xref>, <fn>, and <target> (the simple links) to 
     <on-behalf-of>.

 19. NEW TOGGLE ATTRIBUTE
     @toggle added to the attributes for <underline> through
     %underline-atts;.

 18. NEW ELEMENT <era>
     Added to the model of <date>, optional following year.

 17. XML Base
     Added the attribute @xml:base to the Global (common)
     attributes used on all elements.

 16. INSTITUTION WRAP ADDED
     Added the elements <institution-wrap> to the following elements
     through the institution-wrap.class:
      - <address>
      - <conf-sponsor>
      - <funding-source>
      - <publisher-name>
      - <std-organization>

 15. ABSTRACTS AND KEYWORDS 
     The 2 new classes described in #14 were used to add 
     <abstract> and <keyword> to many elements in the Archiving
     and Publishing models. Since these were NOT to be added to
     Authoring, some elements that did not need to be
     redefined before, now need to be redefined. No content
     model changes were made by these redefinitions.
     - disp-formula-group
     - statement
    
 14. ABSTRACTS AND KEYWORDS
       Changed "abstract*" to "(%abstract.class;)*"
       and "kwd-group*" to "(%kwd-group.class;)*" since those
       classes now exist. Elements should have a limited number of
       ways to be invoked.
        - article-meta (through %article-meta-model;)

     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
   
 13. RELATED OBJECT - Added <related-object> everywhere
     <related-article> was used, including inside 
     <article-meta> using article-meta-model.

 12. CONTRIBUTOR MODEL - Added "contrib-id.class" to the beginning
     at the <contrib> model, to hold identifiers for people,
     such as publishers-specific IDs, ORCIDs, and JST and NII 
     identifiers.
   
 11. STANDARDS ORGANIZATION - Added std-organization-elements
     to reduce what was allowed in the names of standards bodies.
   
 10. PARAGRAPH PARAMETER ENTITY SYNTAX CHANGE (no models changed)
     Fixed content models that were stated as "p*", "p+", and
     "sec*" to use the %just-para.class; and %sec.class; classes. 
     Element models that were changed include:
      - abstract
      - ack
      - app-group
      - disp-quote-model
      - glossary
      - ref-list
   
  9. Updated the public identifier to "v1.0 20120330//EN", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "1".

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
  8. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
  7. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/0.4.

  6. KEYWORD GROUP - Made <kwd-group> repeatable inside
     <article-meta> by modifying %article-meta-model;

  5. MEDIA - In 3.0 <graphic> and <media> used the same model,
     defined by %graphic-model;. In 0.4, %media-model; was added to
     separate the redefinition possibilities. Since Authoring had
     redefined %graphic-model;, the same redefinition was necessary
     for <media> through %media-model;.

  4. INITIALS - Removed the attribute over-ride for <surname> and
     <given-names> to allow the use of @initials.

  3. PERSON-GROUP - Became a mixed-content model, so the parameter
     entity %person-group-model: was changed to
     %person-group-elements;, which will be mixed with #PCDATA
     as defined in references.ent. The PE person-group-model has
     been retained in references.ent for compatibility, but has been
     set to the mixed model using person-group-elements.

  2. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use
     to the following over-rides:
      - fn through fn-atts (@specific-use only; @xml:lang already)
      - inline-graphic-atts through inline-graphic-atts (both)
      - list through list-atts (@xml:lang only; @specific-use already)
      - person-group through person-group-atts (both
      - underline through underline-atts (both)

     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

                          - including table elements for both the 
                              XHTML-inspired and OASIS-inspired
                              table model elements
                          - excluding only <mml:math> and 
                              <xi:include> (whose namespaces JATS
                              does not control).
                           Great care should be taken to use these
                        attributes judiciously, not as a shortcut to
                        thinking through where an attribute should be
                        used. Potential use cases include adding
                        @xml:lang or some RDFa attribute to every 
                        elements.                                  -->
