           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/

 12. NEW CODE ELEMENT- Added <code> to
      - alternatives-display.class
      - block-display.class
      - simple-display.class

 11. NEW CODE ELEMENT- Added <code> to 
      -  alternatives-display.class

  9. CITATION ALTERNATIVES - Added a new element 
     <citation-alternatives> to the citation.class. The element
     will hold, for example, a single citation in multiple

     <element-citation> with all punctuation and spacing removed.

     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.

     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/0.4.

  5. ALTERNATIVES - Added <private-char> so that the alternatives
     wrapper may be used to hold alternative characters, some as
     <private-char>, some as <textual-form>, some as <graphic>,
     etc.

  4. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Added the element <aff-alternatives>
     to contrib-info.class to hold multiple <aff>s that are

  3. NAME ALTERNATIVES - Added <name-alternatives> to
     name.class, to therefore be used where name is allowed.

  2. EMPHASIS CLASS - Added <san-serif> to emphasis elements.
