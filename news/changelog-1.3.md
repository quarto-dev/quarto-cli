## Changes

## HTML Format

- Improved handling of margin references that appear within a callout. (#3003)
- Add support for customizing the baseline widths of grid columns using yaml or scss.

## Dates

- Properly fall back to language only locale when a supported language-region locale isn't available. (#3059)

## About Pages

- Add support for `image-alt` which provides alternate text for the about page image. (#3010)

## Listings

- Listings now support `template-params`, which will be passed to custom EJS templates in a variable called `templateParams` when a listing is rendered.
- Custom listing objects now resolve `path: ` fields into the metadata that would be generated by standard listings, giving custom listing access to computed metadata like `reading-time`, etc.
