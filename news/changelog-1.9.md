## Projects

### `website`

- ([#13524](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13524)): Add support for Plausible Analytics via `plausible-analytics` configuration option.

- ([#13525](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13525)): Algolia Insights now uses privacy-friendly defaults: `useCookie: false` with random session tokens when cookie consent is not configured.
