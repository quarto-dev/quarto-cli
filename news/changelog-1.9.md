- ([#13589](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13589)): Fix callouts with invalid ID prefixes crashing with "attempt to index a nil value". Callouts with unknown reference types now render as non-crossreferenceable callouts with a warning, ignoring the invalid ID.

- ([#13775](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13775)): Fix brand fonts not being applied when using `citeproc: true` with Typst format. Format detection now properly handles Pandoc format variants like `typst-citations`.
- ([#13249](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/13249)): Update to Pandoc's Typst template following Pandoc 3.8.3 and Typst 0.14.2 support:

- ([#13870](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13870)): Add support for `alt` attribute on cross-referenced equations for improved accessibility. (author: @mcanouil)

### `pdf`

- ([#13661](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13661)): Fix LaTeX compilation errors when using `mermaid-format: svg` with PDF/LaTeX output. SVG diagrams are now written directly without HTML script tags. Note: `mermaid-format: png` is recommended for best compatibility. SVG format requires `rsvg-convert` (or Inkscape with `use-rsvg-convert: false`) in PATH for conversion to PDF, and may experience text clipping in diagrams with multi-line labels.
- ([rstudio/tinytex-releases#49](https://github.com/rstudio/tinytex-releases/issues/49)): Fix detection of LuaTeX-ja missing file errors by matching both "File" and "file" in error messages.

- ([#13730](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13730)): Fix TinyTeX detection when `~/.TinyTeX/` directory exists without binaries. Quarto now verifies that the bin directory and tlmgr binary exist before reporting TinyTeX as available, allowing proper fallback to system PATH installations.
- ([#13249](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/13249)): Update to Pandoc's LaTeX template following Pandoc 3.8.3 support:
  - New RTL support for LuaTeX with `\RL`, `\LR` commands and `RTL`, `LTR` environments.
  - New `shorthands` variable for Babel language shortcuts control.
  - New `pdf-trailer-id` support for reproducible PDF builds.
  - New `cancel` package support for `\cancel` command in math.

### `revealjs`

- ([#13722](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13722)): Fix `light-content` / `dark-content` SCSS rules not included in Reveal.js format. (author: @mcanouil)

## Projects

- ([#13892](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13892)): Fix `output-dir: ./` deleting entire project directory. `output-dir` must be a subdirectory of the project directory and check is now better to avoid deleting the project itself when it revolves to the same path.

### `website`

- ([#13524](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13524)): Add support for Plausible Analytics via `plausible-analytics` configuration option. Users can either paste their Plausible script snippet directly in YAML or provide a path to a file containing the snippet using `plausible-analytics: { path: _plausible_snippet.html }`.
- ([#13525](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13525)): Algolia Insights now uses privacy-friendly defaults: `useCookie: false` with random session tokens when cookie consent is not configured. When `cookie-consent: true` is enabled, Algolia scripts are deferred and only use cookies after user grants "tracking" consent, ensuring GDPR compliance.
- ([#13547](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13547))`cookie-content: { type: express }` is now the default. Previously it was `type: implied`. It now means this will block cookies until the user expressly agrees to allow them (or continue blocking them if the user doesn't agree).
- ([#13570](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/13570)): Replace Twitter with Bluesky in default blog template and documentation examples. New blog projects now include Bluesky social links instead of Twitter.
- ([#13716](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13716)): Fix draft pages showing blank during preview when pre-render scripts are configured.
- ([#13847](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/13847)): Open graph title with markdown is now processed correctly. (author: @mcanouil)
- ([#12667](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/12667)): Add support for multiple category selection in listings using Ctrl/Cmd+click. Selected categories are persisted in the URL hash as comma-separated values. (author: @mcanouil)

### `book`

- ([#13769](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13769)): Apply `repo-link-target` and `repo-link-rel` options to tools in book sidebar for consistent link attribute handling with website projects. (author: @mcanouil)

### `manuscript`

- ([#10031](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10031)): Fix manuscript rendering prompting for GitHub credentials when origin points to private repository. Auto-detection of manuscript URL now fails gracefully with a warning instead of blocking renders.

## Publishing

### Confluence

- ([#13414](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13414)): Be more forgiving when Confluence server returns malformed JSON response. (author: @m1no)

## Lua API

- ([#13762](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13762)): Add `quarto.paths.typst()` to Quarto's Lua API to resolve Typst binary path in Lua filters and extensions consistently with Quarto itself. (author: @mcanouil)

## Commands

### `use brand`

- ([#13828](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/13828)): New `quarto use brand` command copies and synchronizes the `_brand/` directory from a repo, directory, or ZIP file. See [the prerelease documentation](https://prerelease.quarto.org/docs/authoring/brand.html#quarto-use-brand) for details.

### `call build-ts-extension`

- (): New `quarto call build-ts-extension` command builds a TypeScript extension, such as an engine extension, and places the artifacts in the `_extensions` directory. See the [engine extension pre-release documentation](https://prerelease.quarto.org/docs/extensions/engine.html) for details.

## Extensions

- Metadata and brand extensions now work without a `_quarto.yml` project. (Engine extensions do too.) A temporary default project is created in memory.

- New **Engine Extensions**, to allow other execution engines than knitr, jupyter, julia. Julia is now a bundled extension. See [the prerelease notes](https://prerelease.quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.9/) and [engine extension documentation](https://prerelease.quarto.org/docs/extensions/engine.html).

## Engines

### `jupyter`

- ([#13748](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/13748)): Fix stdin encoding to UTF-8 on Windows to correctly handle JSON in documents containing non-ASCII characters.

## Other fixes and improvements

- ([#8730](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/8730)): Detect x64 R crashes on Windows ARM and provide helpful error message directing users to install native ARM64 R instead of showing generic "check your R installation" error.
- ([#13402](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13402)): `nfpm` (<https://nfpm.goreleaser.com/>) is now used to create the `.deb` package, and new `.rpm` package. Both Linux packages are also now built for `x86_64` (`amd64`) and `aarch64` (`arm64`) architectures.
- ([#13528](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/13528)): Adds support for table specification using nested lists and the `list-table` class.
- ([#13575](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/13575)): Improve CPU architecture detection/reporting in macOS to allow quarto to run in virtualized environments such as OpenAI's `codex`.
- ([#13656](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13656)): Fix R code cells with empty `lang: ""` option producing invalid markdown class attributes.
- ([#13832](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/13832)): Fix `license.text` metadata not being accessible when using an inline license (`license: "text"`), and populate it with the license name for CC licenses instead of empty string. (author: @mcanouil)
- ([#13856](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13856)): Add code annotation support for Typst and Observable.js code blocks. (author: @mcanouil)
- ([#13907](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/13907)): Ignore AI assistant configuration files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`) when scanning for project input files and in extension templates, similar to how `README.md` is handled.
