## `quarto check`

- ([#11608](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/11608)): Do not issue error message when calling `quarto check info`.

## `html` format

- ([#11860])(https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11860)): ES6 modules that import other local JS modules in documents with `embed-resources: true` are now correctly embedded.

## `pdf` format

- ([#11903](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11903)): `crossref` configuration like `fig-title` or `tbl-title` now correctly supports multi word values, e.g. `fig-title: 'Supplementary Figure'`.

## `typst` format

- ([#11578](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11578)): Typst column layout widths use fractional `fr` units instead of percent `%` units for unitless and default widths in order to fill the enclosing block and not spill outside it.

- ([#11964](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11964)): Using panel layout without a crossref label now correctly do not add an empty `#block[]` that was leading to an unnecessary space in output.

## Lua Filters and extensions

- ([#11526](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/11526)):
  General improvements to the style and robustness of Quarto's Lua code.
  This also provides a new public function `quarto.utils.is_empty_node`
  that allows to check whether a node is empty, i.e., whether it's an
  empty list, has no child nodes, and contains no text.
- ([#11699](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11699)): Fix crash with `video` shortcode inside HTML comments.
- Expose new `quarto.paths.tinytex_bin_dir` in Quarto's Lua API. If TinyTeX is found by Quarto, this will be set to the path to the `bin` directory of the TinyTeX installation where command line tool are located (e.g., `pdflatex`, `tlmgr`, etc.). If TinyTeX is not found, this will be `nil`, meaning Quarto will use the system PATH to find the command line tools.
- Fix `pandoc.mediabag` Lua typings so autocompletions work with the Lua LSP integration.

## Engines

### `julia`

- ([#11659](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/11659)): Fix escaping bug where paths containing spaces or backslashes break server startup on Windows.

- ([#8613](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/8613)): Fix `giscus` color on load to support dark mode (by @kv9898).

- ([#11643](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11643)): Improve highlighting of nested code block inside markdown code block, i.e. using ` ```{{python}} ` or ` ```python ` inside ` ````markdown` fenced code block.
- ([fb38eb5](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/commit/fb38eb56c11e09f44cef58fd3b697ff24bb5a3f3)) Use the `latest` parser for Acorn when analyzing JS code imported from OJS blocks.
- ([#10532](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10532)): Quarto changed default of `--headless=old` to `--headless` as [Chrome 132 has removed old headless mode](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/removing-headless-old-from-chrome) and only support new mode. For using old mode, `QUARTO_CHROMIUM` could be set to a [new `chrome-headless-shell` binary](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-headless-shell) or too an older chrome version (between 128 and 132) and `QUARTO_CHROMIUM_HEADLESS_MODE` set to `old` for using old headless mode with that compatabitle version.
- ([#10961](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10961)): Add more information on which Chrome Headless will be used in `quarto check install`. This is helpful to help debug mermaid issues.
