## Lua Filters and extensions

- ([#11526](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/11526)):
  General improvements to the style and robustness of Quarto's Lua code.
  This also provides a new public function `quarto.utils.is_empty_node`
  that allows to check whether a node is empty, i.e., whether it's an
  empty list, has no child nodes, and contains no text.
- ([#11699](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11699)): Fix crash with `video` shortcode inside HTML comments.
- Expose new `quarto.paths.tinytex_bin_dir` in Quarto's Lua API. If TinyTeX is found by Quarto, this will be set to the path to the `bin` directory of the TinyTeX installation where command line tool are located (e.g., `pdflatex`, `tlmgr`, etc.). If TinyTeX is not found, this will be `nil`, meaning Quarto will use the system PATH to find the command line tools.
- Fix `pandoc.mediabag` Lua typings so autocompletions work with the Lua LSP integration.
- ([#11896](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/11896)): fix `\f` (`{{< pagebreak >}}`) form feed character not valid in PowerPoint (`pptx`).
- ([#11664](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11664)): `lipsum` shortcode is no longer randomly generated by default, use `{{< lipsum random=true >}}` to restore randomness.

## Engines

### `julia`

- ([#12121](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/12121)): Update QuartoNotebookRunner to 0.14.0. Support for evaluating Python cells via [PythonCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PythonCall.jl) added. Support for notebook caching via `execute.cache` added.
- ([#12151](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/12151)): Basic YAML validation is now active for document using Julia engine.

### `jupyter`

- ([#12114](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/12114)): `JUPYTERCACHE` environment variable from [Jupyter cache CLI](https://jupyter-cache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/cli.html) is now respected by Quarto when `cache: true` is used. This environment variable allows to change the path of the cache directory.

## Other Fixes and Improvements

- ([#7260](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/7260)): Add support for `active` class in tabsets so the `.active` tab shows up by default.

- ([#11643](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11643)): Improve highlighting of nested code block inside markdown code block, i.e. using ` ```{{python}} ` or ` ```python ` inside ` ````markdown` fenced code block.

- ([#10532](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10532)): Quarto changed default of `--headless=old` to `--headless` as [Chrome 132 has removed old headless mode](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/removing-headless-old-from-chrome) and only support new mode. For using old mode, `QUARTO_CHROMIUM` could be set to a [new `chrome-headless-shell` binary](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-headless-shell) or too an older chrome version (between 128 and 132) and `QUARTO_CHROMIUM_HEADLESS_MODE` set to `old` for using old headless mode with that compatabitle version.
- ([#10961](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10961)): Add more information on which Chrome Headless will be used in `quarto check install`. This is helpful to help debug mermaid issues.
