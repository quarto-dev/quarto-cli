## Engines

### `knitr`

- ([#14735](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/14735)): Fix `cache-globals` rejecting arrays and booleans, so it now accepts the same forms as `cache-vars` and as knitr itself. Previously only a single string validated, which rejected both `cache-globals: [var_1, var_2]` and the documented `cache-globals: false`.

## Crossrefs

- Adds `axiom` (`axm`) and `assumption` (`asm`) theorem environments with english and spanish defaults (`_language_yml`, `_language-es.yml`), sets `algorithm` (`alg`) style to definition and wires title-to-prefix inheritance for theorem cross-references.

## Other fixes and improvements

- [#14735](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/14735) Fix a crash when the `QUARTO_R` environment variable is set to a malformed path. Quarto now warns and falls back to other R lookup strategies instead of aborting the render. ([posit-dev/positron#15614](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/discussions/15614))
