All changes included in 1.11:

## Accessibility

- ([#14615](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/14615)): Fix invalid `role="menu"` on the website navbar's collapse toggle button, flagged by axe-core (`aria-allowed-role`) and WAVE (`aria_menu_broken`) when the navbar collapses to the hamburger at narrow viewports.

## Engines

### `knitr`

- ([#14735](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/14735)): Fix `cache-globals` rejecting arrays and booleans, so it now accepts the same forms as `cache-vars` and as knitr itself. Previously only a single string validated, which rejected both `cache-globals: [var_1, var_2]` and the documented `cache-globals: false`.
