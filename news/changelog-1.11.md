## Commands

### `quarto preview`

- ([#14783](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/14783)): Fix `quarto preview` ignoring project metadata contributed by an extension, such as `brand`. (author: @mcanouil)

## Engines

### `knitr`

- ([#14735](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/14735)): Fix `cache-globals` rejecting arrays and booleans, so it now accepts the same forms as `cache-vars` and as knitr itself. Previously only a single string validated, which rejected both `cache-globals: [var_1, var_2]` and the documented `cache-globals: false`.
