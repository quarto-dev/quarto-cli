- ([#10188](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10188)): `quarto inspect` properly resolves includes across subdirectory boundaries.

## Lua Filters

- ([#10004](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10004)): Resolve callout titles, theorem names, and `code-summary` content through `quarto_ast_pipeline()` and `process_shortcodes()`.
- ([#10196](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10196)): Protect against nil values in `float.caption_long`.

- ([#10624](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10624)): Don't crash when proof environments are empty in `pdf`.

## `revealjs` Format

- Update to Reveal JS 5.1.0.
- ([#7715](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/7715)): Revealjs don't support anymore special Pandoc syntax making BulletList in Blockquotes become incremental list. This was confusing and unexpected behavior. Supported syntax for incremental list is documented at <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/#incremental-lists>.

## `typst` Format

- ([#10168](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10168)): Support `csl` bibliography style.
- ([#10181](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10181)): Remove workaround for image dimensions which is no longer necessary and mishandled image paths with spaces.
- ([#10217](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10217)): Explicitly compute units for image dimensions in `typst` format when they're not given.
- ([#10212](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10212)): Moves Pandoc variables to the function declaration for the default template.

## `latex` and `pdf` Format

- ([#10291](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10291)): Several improvement regarding Quarto LaTeX engine behavior for missing hyphenation log message:
  - `latex-auto-install: false` now correctly opt out any missing hyphenation packages detection and installation. Only a warning will be thrown if any detected in the log.
  - For default behavior (`latex-auto-install: true`), detection is still happening and missing packages are installed automatically. If it fails, Quarto does not fail anymore as PDF rendering as succeeded already. Only a warning will be thrown to log the installation failure.
  - Log message about hyphenation package missing for `chinese` or `chinese-hans` languages are now ignored.
- ([#10655](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10655)): Missing fonts from fontspec error are correctly detected and looked for to be installed.
