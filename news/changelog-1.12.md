All changes included in 1.12:

## Formats

### `pdf`

- ([#15251](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/15251)): Fix algorithm blocks (`#alg-`) being set in italics. Their body is now upright, like definitions, examples and exercises. (author: @mcanouil)

### `typst`

- ([#15168](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/15168)): Fix definitions, examples and exercises being set in italics in Typst output with the default `theorem-appearance: simple`. Their body is now upright, as in LaTeX output, while theorems, lemmas, corollaries, propositions and conjectures keep an italic body. (author: @mcanouil)
- ([#15251](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/15251)): Fix algorithm blocks (`#alg-`) being set in italics with `theorem-appearance: simple` and using the colours of theorems with `theorem-appearance: fancy`. They now look like definitions, examples and exercises. (author: @mcanouil)

## Projects

### Websites

- ([#13126](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/13126)): Add `pagination` options to listings to set how many page links are shown (`inner-window`, `outer-window`, `outer-window-left`, `outer-window-right`), and label the pagination control for screen readers. (author: @mcanouil)

## Commands

### `quarto preview`

- ([#14783](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/14783)): Fix `quarto preview` ignoring project metadata contributed by an extension, such as `brand`. Contributed project metadata now applies to every command that builds a project context, `quarto inspect` included. (author: @mcanouil)

## Other fixes and improvements

- ([#14822](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/14822)): Translate the `tools-share`, `tools-download`, and `skip-to-content` language keys in Greek. (author: @sogav21)
- ([#14822](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/14822)): The Lithuanian search label and the Swedish caution callout title no longer fall back to English.
- ([#15223](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/15223)): Directories are now read in a fixed order (sorted by name in character-code order, not by locale) on every platform.
  Extension discovery, the theme list of `quarto capabilities`, and the items of a MECA bundle no longer depend on the file system's listing order; when two extensions share an id, which one wins can differ from earlier versions.
