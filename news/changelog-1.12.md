All changes included in 1.12:

## Formats

### `pdf`

- ([#15251](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/15251)): Fix algorithm blocks (`#alg-`) being set in italics. Their body is now upright, like definitions, examples and exercises. (author: @mcanouil)

### `typst`

- ([#15168](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/15168)): Fix definitions, examples and exercises being set in italics in Typst output with the default `theorem-appearance: simple`. Their body is now upright, as in LaTeX output, while theorems, lemmas, corollaries, propositions and conjectures keep an italic body. (author: @mcanouil)
- ([#15251](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/15251)): Fix algorithm blocks (`#alg-`) being set in italics with `theorem-appearance: simple` and using the colours of theorems with `theorem-appearance: fancy`. They now look like definitions, examples and exercises. (author: @mcanouil)

## Commands

### `quarto preview`

- ([#14783](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/14783)): Fix `quarto preview` ignoring project metadata contributed by an extension, such as `brand`. Contributed project metadata now applies to every command that builds a project context, `quarto inspect` included. (author: @mcanouil)
