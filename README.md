# Quarto

Quarto is an academic, scientific, and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org).

In addition to the core capabilities of Pandoc, Quarto includes:

1.  Support for embedding output from Julia, Python, and R via integration with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) .
2.  A project system for rendering groups of documents at once.
3.  Flexible ways to specify rendering options, including project-wide options and per-format options.
4.  Cross references for figures, tables, equations, sections, listings, proofs, and more.
5.  Sophisticated layout for panels of figures, tables, and other content.
6.  Automatic installation of required LaTeX packages when rendering PDF output.

The overall design of Quarto is influenced heavily by [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), however unlike R Markdown the architecture is language agnostic. In it's current iteration, Quarto can render plain markdown, Rmd documents, and Jupyter Notebooks.

Quarto is currently in alpha development, so not generally recommended for everyday use!
