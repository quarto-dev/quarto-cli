# Quarto

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). Quarto documents are authored using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), an easy to write plain text format.

In addition to the core capabilities of Pandoc, Quarto includes:

1.  Support for embedding output from Python, R, and Julia via integration with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) .

2.  A variety of extensions to Pandoc markdown useful for technical writing including callouts (admonitions), cross-references, sub-figures, layout panels, hover-able citations and footnotes, and more.

3.  A project system for rendering groups of documents at once, sharing options across documents, and producing aggregate output like books and websites.

4.  HTML output based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (including support for [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) themes).

5.  Automatic installation of required LaTeX packages when rendering PDF output.

The overall design of Quarto is influenced heavily by [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), however unlike R Markdown the architecture is language agnostic. In it's current iteration, Quarto can render plain markdown, Jupyter Notebooks, and Knitr (Rmd) documents.
