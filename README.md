# Quarto

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). Quarto documents are authored using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), an easy to write plain text format.

In addition to the core capabilities of Pandoc, Quarto includes:

1.  Embedding code and output from Python, R, Julia, and JavaScript via integration with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [Knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/), and [Observable](https://github.com/observablehq/).

2.  A variety of extensions to Pandoc markdown useful for technical writing including cross-references, sub-figures, layout panels, hoverable citations and footnotes, callouts, and more.

3.  A project system for rendering groups of documents at once, sharing options across documents, and producing aggregate output like [websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) and [books](https://quarto.org/docs/books/).

4.  Authoring using a wide variety of editors and notebooks including [JupyterLab](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html), [RStudio](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/rstudio.html), and [VS Code](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html).

5.  A [visual markdown editor](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/) that provides a productive writing interface for composing long-form documents.
