REM This file serves as a translation/setup layer for windows scripts. It reads in the
REM variables from the configuration file in the root of the repo, and outputs them as
REM SET commands in a batch file. It then outputs paths based on the settings in that
REM batch file. The main reason for this file is because batch scripting with delayed
REM expansion can only go one level deep. Paths that are derivatives of other dynamic
REM paths just don't work. It's easier to build them here, then use them in the various
REM other scripts (configure.cmd, download.bat, quarto-bld.cmd).

REM Reads the configuration file line by line
REM and convert any export statements into set statements
REM (allows reuse of variables)
