  description:
    short: "Produce a standalone HTML file with no external dependencies"
    long: |
      Produce a standalone HTML file with no external dependencies, using
      `data:` URIs to incorporate the contents of linked scripts, stylesheets,
      images, and videos. The resulting file should be "self-contained," in the
      sense that it needs no external files and no net access to be displayed
      properly by a browser. This option works only with HTML output formats,
      including `html4`, `html5`, `html+lhs`, `html5+lhs`, `s5`, `slidy`,
      `slideous`, `dzslides`, and `revealjs`. Scripts, images, and stylesheets at
      absolute URLs will be downloaded; those at relative URLs will be sought
      relative to the working directory (if the first source
      file is local) or relative to the base URL (if the first source
      file is remote).  Elements with the attribute
      `data-external="1"` will be left alone; the documents they
      link to will not be incorporated in the document.
      Limitation: resources that are loaded dynamically through
      JavaScript cannot be incorporated; as a result, some
      advanced features (e.g.  zoom or speaker notes) may not work
      in an offline "self-contained" `reveal.js` slide show.

    long: |
      Embed math libraries (e.g. MathJax) within `self-contained` output.
      Note that math libraries are not embedded by default because they are 
       quite large and often time consuming to download.

      Extract images and other media contained in or linked from the source document to the
      path DIR, creating it if necessary, and adjust the images references in the document
      so they point to the extracted files. Media are downloaded, read from the file
      system, or extracted from a binary container (e.g. docx), as needed. The original

      are constructed from the SHA1 hash of the contents.

      Specify a default extension to use when image paths/URLs have no

      This list is used when reading Markdown input: strings found in this list

      Specify the default dpi (dots per inch) value for conversion from pixels to inch/
      centimeters and vice versa. (Technically, the correct term would be ppi: pixels per

      encoded value is used instead of the default specified by this option.
