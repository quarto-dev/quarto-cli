# adapted from https://github.com/marcysutton/reveal-a11y:
# - removed skiplinks plugin b/c we will be including an accessible menu plugin,
# - added some behavior to conditionally show focus rects based on use of
#   the keyboard, and to automatically focus the first focusable element
#   on slide change
