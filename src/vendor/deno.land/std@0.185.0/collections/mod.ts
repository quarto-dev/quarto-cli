/** Functions for specific common tasks around collection types like `Array` and
 * `Record`. This module is heavily inspired by `kotlin`s stdlib.
 *
 * - All provided functions are **pure**, which also means that they do **not
 *   mutate** your inputs, **returning a new value** instead.
 * - All functions are importable on their own by referencing their snake_case
 *   named file (e.g. `collections/sort_by.ts`)
 *
 * This module re-exports several modules, and importing this module directly
 * will likely include a lot of code that you might not use.
 *
 * Consider importing the function directly. For example to import
 * {@linkcode groupBy} import the module using the snake cased version of the
 * module:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { groupBy } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/collections/group_by.ts";
 * ```
 *
 * @module

// Not sure what's causing this warning? Run `deno info <entry-point-path>` to
// analyze the module graph. It's not recommended to import directly from
// mod.ts here because it adds a lot of bloat.
