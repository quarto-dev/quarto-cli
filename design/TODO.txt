- Implement latex environment divs: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html


- Consider purging sandbox history from repo and creating new
  quarto-sandbox repo
  https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/

- We don't seem to be able to render latex quite the same way that kntir does,
e.g.:
library(flextable)
ft <- flextable(head(mtcars))
ft <- autofit(ft)
ft

- Generally, validity of labels (don't want under the hood transformations to 
  affect addressabilty)

- Filter:

    - Build meta latex includes for theoroms off of theoromTypes

    - ?? for refs we don't find

    - consider implementing ref aggregation (e.g. see figs. 1-2)

    - sections



    - Forwarding of fig chunk options to data attributes (and HTML/LaTeX generation)
    - figures filter should run after the crossref filter, and
      should be responsible for converting e.g. htmlwidgets
      marked as figures to <figure>


- allow _quarto config directory that merges all contained files
  (lock file will go there as well)


Port tinytex to JS; OR we need to implmeent various auto-install behaviors for latexmk, eg.
  had to do this to get biblatex working w/ latexmk
  (may want to automate installation if no biber + auto-map TinyTeX to path)
    tlmgr install biblatex
    tlmgr install biber
    ln -sf /Users/jjallaire/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin/biber /usr/local/bin/biber
Note need to implement tinytex: false and tinytex options (e.g. min-runs, clean, output-dir, etc.)

Why did Beamer fail to render w/ missing caption package w/ our pipeline but work for pandoc pdflatex?

Injected HTML in meta.lua gets overridden whenever we use include-in-header in the
defaults file (e.g. for  htmlwidgets). Use temp file?

Project system:
  - See MkDocs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Lp39BolpTR0NzbQQ6ebr9bawYth8EeivBo0q4qapVY/edit#heading=h.ibf8kici39py
  - Terminate at _quarto.yml w/ project: true
    (need to first determine if there is a project somewhere in the parent tree,
     if there is, then use this behavior, if not, use the first match)
  - External interactions with projects (output_dir, clean, etc.)

memo/proposal on computations:
will be able to use RStudio chunk output and/or notebook for compute?
or perhaps require html_notebook?
computations could even be at a URL!!!

More robust Julia backend

Extracate the cache dir logic from rmarkdown::render and call that

Merge -M and --metadata-file with _quarto.yml and in-file YAML with same
semantics as Pandoc

discover index.Rmd or ui.Rmd for quarto run. can't rely on
rmarkdown::run b/c we need to figure out which Rmd to render

Meta-concepts on top of AST: e.g. tabs
